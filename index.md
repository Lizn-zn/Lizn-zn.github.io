## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by [Prof. Zhendong Su](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/). I received my Ph.D. from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/), advised by Prof. Xiaoxing Ma and Prof. Jian Lü. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Southwest Jiaotong University and M.Sc. from the Software Institute of Nanjing University.

My research sits at the intersection of **AI and formal methods**, with a focus on **neuro-symbolic AI**, **LLM-based theorem proving**, and **mathematical reasoning**.

  


## Research Interests

Before the advent of large language models (LLMs), my research primarily focused on the integration of deep learning and software engineering, particularly quality assurance for deep learning models and software engineering automation via deep learning. Additionally, I worked on mathematical optimization, developing fast algorithms and theoretical analysis for minimax/bilevel optimization in large-scale machine learning.

In the LLM era, my research has shifted to neuro-symbolic AI. Beyond exploring the theoretical foundations of neuro-symbolic learning, I am particularly focused on its applications, including LLM-based mathematical reasoning, theorem proving, and verified code generation.
