## About Me
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Computer Software (ICS) at Nanjing University (NJU), advised by Xiaoxing Ma and Jian L\"{u}. 
Since July 2023, I am interning at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), advised by Fan Yang.

## Research Interests 

Before the large language model (LLM) era, my research interests mainly lie in the integration of deep learning and software engineering, especially quality assurance for deep learning models, and software engineering automation via deep learning. 
In addition, I am also focused on the mathematical optimization, particularly developing fast algorithms and theoretical analysis for minimax/bilevel optimization in large-scale machine learning tasks.

In the LLM era, my research interests switch to neuro-symbolic AI. 
Beyond exploring theoretical foundations of neuro-symbolic learning, I am particularly focused on its application, such as using LLMs to perform mathematical reasoning, theorem proving, as well as verified code generation.
